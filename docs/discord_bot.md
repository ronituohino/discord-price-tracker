# Creating a new Discord bot

Create a new Discord bot and add it to your server by following
[this blog](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/nodejs/build-basic-discord-bot-nodejs).

Be sure to enable all privileged gateway intents in the developer portal for the
bot, **otherwise it will not work**

The DISCORD_BOT_SECRET refers to the token in the Bot panel.
